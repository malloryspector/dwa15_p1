        <h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
        <p>I'm a testing development analyst with a background in Graphic Design and a love for Web Development. For a few years after graduating from college, I worked as a Graphic Designer and while I loved the problem solving part of design, it wasn't something I could see myself doing long term. I began to learn how to code and was immediately hooked. I currently do a mix of automated and manual testing for a Boston based e-commerce site, working directly with engineers to ensure code that gets pushed to production is as bug free as possible. I am hoping to continue to learn about programming through work, taking classes, and getting involved in the Web Development community.</p>
        <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
        <p>While I'm very familiar with front end developemnt languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), I am interested in learning how to make websites more dynamic. I would love to transition into a Web Development role in the future and am hoping to continue to increase my skill level and knowlege of programming through this class.</p>
        <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
        <p>Prior to this class, I've taken the Intro to Web Programming Using JavaScript class through Harvard Extension school, gone to a lot of Girl Develop It meetups, and have made my way through most of codecademy. On a daily basis, I use PHP to write automated tests.</p>
        <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
        <p>I switch back and forth between Mac and PC. I'm a Mac lover at heart, but use a PC for work so am often going back and forth between the two.</p>
        <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
        <p>I learn best by doing so the more examples we have to run through the better!</p>
